Swaffield Primary School wordpress theme update for 2012

The main feature of the new theme is the drop-down menu
Depending on which section you are viewing a side-menu
appears which is the same as the drop down for that 
particular section. These menus can all be edited using
the Links manager.

The idea was to create a less cluttered look to the site
but at the same time improve the navigation. The updates
are all based on research and feedback from users.
